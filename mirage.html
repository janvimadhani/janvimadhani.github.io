					<h1>Mirage Earths</h1>
          Low mass M dwarf stars have recently become popular targets for planet searches, 
          particularly those aiming to find potentially habitable Earth-size planets. Not only are M dwarfs the most 
          numerous stars in the galaxy, but their low luminosities mean that their habitable zone is much closer in,
          making such planets easier to find around these stars.
          
          However, in a recent <i>Astrobiology</i> article, I found that the habitability of many planets around M dwarfs 
          may be compromised by processes that happen early on, shortly after their formation. These stars spend their first several
          hundred million years in a superluminous phase with vigorous magnetic activity, blasting any HZ planets with
          enough high energy radiation to vaporize their surface water and cause it to escape to space. 
          
          In addition to losing the equivalent of many Earth oceans of water, these planets may also build up large amounts
          of oxygen from the photolysis of their water. This is important since we typically think of oxygen as a biosignature gas --
          that is, a sign that life may be present, as it is on Earth. However, this is certainly not true for many planets
          orbiting M dwarfs, as the evolution of life on these planets may have been stunted early on.
